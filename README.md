# Classification-of-text-through-Multinomial-Naive-Bayes-
This is a classic algorithm for text classification and natural language processing (NLP).

This classifier is “naive” because it assumes independence between “features”, in this case: words. Said differently: each word is treated as having no connection with other words in the sentence being classified.

This is to say, in the sentence “the fox jumped over the log”, there is no relationship between “jumped” and “fox” or “log”. This ensemble of words is often referred to (by NLP types) as “a bag of words”. While this is incredibly naive, the classifier isn’t attempting to understand the meaning of a sentence, it’s trying to classify it.
